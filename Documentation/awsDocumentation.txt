Docker hosting research. Task #27

1:	Amazon Elastic Container Service(ECS)
	-	Free use through being a UB student
		o	ECS is free, but the ECS extension(fargate) is pricey

	-	Lots of documentation online on how to do it
		o	Just have to find what documentation hooks up with our implementation

2: 	Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kuberetes (EKS)
		-Free use through being a UB student
		-Very difficult setup difficulty
		-Tons of flexibility
		- Allows multiple applications per host
			-Probably don’t need this
		- Can run in multiple place(main selling point)
			-AWS
			-Azure
			-Google cloud
			-on-premises
			-Local machine(probably not)
		
3:	AWS Elastic Beanstalk(EB) with single Container Docker
		-Free use through being a UB student
		-Low setup complexity
			-Easy to use
		-Lowest operational effort
		-High maturity
		-Single docker container
